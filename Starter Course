I have finished reading the course. In my experience with modding consoles, restoring handhelds, 
modding games and upgrading consoles I have used github a ton, but mostly just going to the page 
and downloading the repositories. I am still getting confused on how to read the pages but this 
guide was very helpful in learning how to navigate and create on github.
