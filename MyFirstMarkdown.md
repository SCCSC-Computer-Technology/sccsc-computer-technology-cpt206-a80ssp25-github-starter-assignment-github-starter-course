# Creating the title header for a new markdown

## Creating a smaller header here

### And yet an even smaller header

- This statement should be normal.
- *This statement should be italicized.*
- **This statement should be bold.**

I have learned what some of the terms used in GitHub are, including:
1. Repository - Think of it as a file folder for your projects
2. Cloning - Creating a local copy of a repository
3. Committing - Saves the changes you made to your repository
4. Pushing - Uploads the changes of your local repository to your online repository (GitHub)
5. Branches - Used to isolate your work to test new features or work out bugs
6. Fork - A copy of a repository, usually someone elses so you can make changes independently
7. Pull Request - After updates have been made, a pull request can be used to ask for feedback before merging to the main repository
8. Issues - Like a sticky note on your repository, used as a way to keep track of things

I believe I have a better understanding of how it works, the biggest issue now is simply getting more familiar with it so I know how everything functions.
